=== How to read this file :
<foo> means that foo is mandatory, [bar] means that bar can be ommited.
Ex : if the help file says "/somecmd <nick> [count]" you have to type something like "/somecmd WonderNick" or "/somecmd Venn 42".


=== Commands :
!get <item> [count]	: Gives what was asked. count can be up to 512.
!get <kit>			: Gives the said kit.
!geta <item>		: Gives one item at a time.
!goto <nick>		: Teleports the player to another one.
!motd				: Shows the motd.
!list				: Shows the connected players.


=== Op commands :
/allowitem <item>		: Removes an item from the blacklist.
/disallowitem <item>	: Adds an item to the blacklist.
/reset <nick>			: Kicks the player and deletes its .dat file. The nick is case-sensitive on UNIXes.
/backup					: Backups the world and the _server.jar. Will not work on Windows because the OS lacks basic tools.


=== Items :
Can be given from name or ID. Names are more like aliases, you can edit items.txt if you want.
64 units of the item will be given by default.


=== Kits :
To add kits, edit kits.txt. One kit per line.
kitname=<item> <count> [<item> <count>]+
item can be an item name or it's ID.


=== Items blacklist :
Players have to be op to !get those items.
One item ID per line in the file items_blacklist.txt


=== Server :
The server will keep running until a stop command is issued from stdin. Even ops won't be able to stop the server, only restart it.


=== Config :
The wrapper.properties files contains everything and is self-explanatory.
When something is disabled, not even ops can use it.
You have to restart the server after modifying the files.


=== Greeting :
If enable-greeting is set to true, when a player connects the server will tell him if there are other players connected.


=== Error codes :
0 Everything was fine.
1 Could not launch the Wrapper thread, WTF ?
2 Could not execute minecraft_server.jar.
3 Could not create or load the configuration files.


=== Examples :
!get stone 				: Gives 64 units of stone.
!geta boat				: Gives 1 boat.
!get 322 512			: Gives 512 golden apples.
/disallowitem bedrock	: Only ops will now be able to get bedrock (via !get or /give).


=== Login :
Requires PHP (or your own implementation).
If minecraft.net is down, you still can check players' IPs to see if they are allowed to join.
"Accounts" are to be created in logins.inc.php, then players can log in and their IP will be stored for two minutes.
During these two minutes, they will be able to join the server with the same IP they used when accessing the login page.
If you want to write your own implementation of this, there is only one thing to implement :
The wrapper will ask for login-url?check=<IP>&user=<nick>
Where <IP> is the IP of the player who is joining and <nick> his username. The URL has to yield 'true' for the IP to be validated,
every other value will be rejected.
You can even make pay-to-play servers with that.
/!\ ips.inc.php must be writable by PHP for this to work.


=== Developers :
Main lauches a Wrapper (which is a Thread), then Thread::run looks for events and send them to EventHandler.
Every command can be found in EventHandler.java.
There is a Doxyfile file provided for you to use with doxygen.
